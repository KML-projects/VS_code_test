var lifeLine = `<div id="temptext"><h1><a href="https://psychiclibrary.com/palmistry-life-line">The Life Line</a></h1><p>The line on the palm that people are most curious about is the life line. This line begins between the index finger and the thumb and continues downward toward the base of the thumb and the connection to the wrist. A common misconception about the life line is that it reveals how long you will live or when you will die. It does however, reveal information about the encounters in your life, relationships with others, health and physical and emotional well-being.Listed below are the meanings of the various shapes, depths and lengths of the life line:</p>
<p><u>Long and deep line</u> - Indicates good health, stamina, vitality and a well-balanced individual.</p>
<p><u>Short and deep line</u> - Indicates the ability to overcome physical problems. It is a myth that a short life line signifies a short life. If the life line is short and shallow, it may signify that other people can easily influence or control you.</p>
<p><u>Deep line</u> - Indicates a smoother life path.</p>
<p><u>Faint line</u> - Indicates a person with low energy and having a less adventurous life.</p>
<p><u>Broken line</u> - Indicates struggles, losses, unexpected change or interruption in your way of living, an accident or an illness. A break in the life line on one hand can signify that you may get ill and recover quickly. A break in the life line on both hands can signify that you may suffer a serious illness or disease. If there is a break near the wrist area in the line, it can indicate problems in early childhood.</p>
<p><u>Chained line</u> - You are susceptible to health or emotional problems. You may also experience a life path that takes you in many directions.</p>
<p><u>Forked line</u> - This type of line has various meanings depending on the fork placement on the hand. Generally, forks indicate an interruption, redirection or life change. It can sometimes mean that you are surrounded by scattered or split energies. If it leads to the Mount of Jupiter, it indicates success and recognition. If it forks to the Mount of Moon it indicates traveling to far off places.</p>
<p><u>Double or triple line</u> - Indicates that you are surrounded by positive energies and you have great stamina. You might possibly be a twin or have found a true partner and soul mate, or you have someone watching over you. However, it may also mean that you are living a double life.</p>
<p><u>Absent line</u> - Indicates a high-strung, anxious and nervous individual.</p>
<p><u>Branched line</u> - Upward branches indicate achievement and success and downward branches indicate poor physical and emotional health, money problems, feelings of sadness and loss. Lines extending up and above the life line show an ability to recover from situations. Lines extending below the life line signify habitually wasting energy.</p>

They can communicate their ideas well and are sensitive, which makes them primed for success and good fortune. However, the line may not be continuous, due to the fact that life is not free of difficulties.</p><p>This may be a sign of inconsistencies in one's life.</p><p>If this line does not appear on the palm, it does not have any correlation to one's success or failure.</p><p>Markings on this line can indicate times of illness or setbacks.</p>`;

var braceletLines = `<div id="temptext"><a href="https://psychiclibrary.com/palmistry-bracelet-lines/"><h1>The Bracelet Lines</a></h1><p>In palmistry, the bracelet lines or rascette lines are considered part of the minor lines. The bracelet/rascette lines are located at the base of the palm on the wrists. The majority of people have three bracelet lines, however, some lucky people have four. Four lines is an indication that one may live to be close to 100. The lines can reveal a person's longevity, health, destiny, prosperity and the balance or imbalance of the mind, body and spirit. The more solid and unbroken the lines, the better the chances are for a good healthy life. Listed below are the meanings of the various shapes, depths and lengths of the Bracelet/Rascette Lines:</p>
<p><u>The First Bracelet</u> - If the first bracelet line (located closest to the palm) is clear and well defined, without any gaps, breaks or chains, it indicates good health. If it is broken and contains gaps, breaks or chains, it is a sign of overindulgence and not taking responsibility for the proper care of one's health. If a woman's line is bowed and turned upward, she will come across many obstacles in her life and endure much pain. There may be childbirth complications or she may only have one or two children. If the second line on the wrist bows upward as the first one does, she may endure pain longer than she expected.</p>
<p>If the first bracelet line is chained and the other lines are clear and defined, this may indicate a life of hard work and difficulty in the earlier years, but hopefully, later in life you will have good fortune.</p>
<p><u>The Second Bracelet Line</u>  - If clear and defined, without any gaps breaks or chains, may indicate financial prosperity and a life you can take joy.</p>
<p><u>The Third Bracelet Line</u> - If clear and defined, without any gaps breaks or chains, can indicate that you can become influential in the community and a well-known individual amongst your peers.</p>
<p>Note, that if you have only one bracelet line, there is a grave possibility that you may not experience the best health during a period in your lifetime or you may experience bouts of depression. If the first line has a tendency to curve and the next lines are well defined and solid, this is a sign that obstacles were overcome in the early years of life through great effort and hard work to take a healthier path. If your upper bracelet/rascette lines are chained, it is not always a bad sign. Through all the turmoil that life can bring, having these lines suggest that happiness is not out of reach.</p></div>`;

If the travel line has many divergences, then you will travel everywhere without definite residence.</p>
<p>- If the travel line extends from the end of life line to the Mercury Mount under the little figure, you may immigrate or settle abroad and spend your remaining years there in comfort.</p>
<p>- If the travel line bifurcates at the tail end of life line and extends to the Luna Mount across the Neptune Mount, then you love to travel everywhere, tend to be far away from home or have no definite residence and often move. If the Neptune Mount is sinking and flat, however, it suggests you have health problems and do things anticlimactically; you are persistent and often suffer setbacks. Therefore, infrequent travel is advised.</p>
<p>- If the travel lines intersect in a cross, you will get help while travelling and can get fame and wealth when you develop elsewhere.</p>
<p>- If the travel lines look like a hill, you will suffer from disputes and be enraged easily or fall into the other's trap, leading to a disaster.</p>
<p>- If the travel lines break or are in chain, you may encounter an accident or danger in travel.</p></div>`;

<p>Pluto has similar qualities to the Moon mount, and when well developed, the nurturing qualities, intuition and imagination are active. Overly enlarged, (when it appears to hang onto the wrist) implies amplification of these qualities; they may be highly intuitive (or even fanatical).</p>
<p>With the well-developed Mount of Pluto, in some instances, there may be some instability regarding the psyche. There may be some mental illness or insanity; depending on other weak aspects. Abnormally short or crooked fingers, or very long, thin fingers are some of the more fragile signs. A small or short thumb would also add to this attribute as with a marked, broken, dipping or missing head line. The main indication of instability is a long and narrow hand. Accentuated water qualities give impractical traits.</p>
<p>Ideally, the most favourable Pluto Mount should be free from other lines and disturbances. The mount of Moon above it should be bouncy with minimal lines or marks.</p></div>`;
